# Weather Dashboard

Using the OpenWeather API, this app enables users to search by either a zip code or a city name to get the current weather and a 5-day forecast.

## The Challenges

This app brought together several stacks in a way that was very fulfilling and educational for me. Using bootstrap, I was able to style the elements quickly and cleanly. Using JQuery, I moved through the JavaScript functions logically with code that is straightforward and easy to read. And finally, using the fetch function on multiple API searches, I could extend the basic app requirements into searching by either zip code or city name.

Setting and getting the local storage was a challenging piece to this app puzzle, but in the end the user experience is lovely and worth the time spent on getting it right.
